These tasks can range from silently utilizing your GPU to mine bitcoin, all the way to encrypting your hard drive and demanding a ransom for its contents. Some common types of malware are adware, viruses, and trojans."

It may also be beneficial to use a trusted adblock extension to help prevent you from accidentally clicking on malicious advertisements. It also comes down to common sense. Never click links that random people send you. In fact, it is a good idea not to click on links that look suspicious even if it is from a person you trust. Typically, suspicious links try to mimic trustworthy links in an attempt to fool the user. It is also always a good idea to back up your hard drive contents to preserve any important documents that may be lost when a virus infects your computer."
